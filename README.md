# Image Collage Generator

## Description

This project was developed as a challenge submission for HackVenture 1.0 organized by the University of Kaleniya. Our team, Team Epsilon, participated in this challenge and implemented the solution presented in this repository.

The jupyter notebook generates a collage of images by applying various filters to input images and arranging them in a grid layout. The notebook provides functionalities to delete files/folders, copy files from Google Drive, check the number of channels in images, duplicate images, rename files, and apply filters. It utilizes libraries such as PyTorch and PIL for image processing and manipulation.

## Example Output

<div style="display: flex; flex-align:center; flex-direction:center">
    <img src="TeamEpsilon_week1.png" style="width: 50%; ">
    <span>With filters</span>
</div>


## Features

- Deletes files and folders recursively
- Copies files from Google Drive
- Checks the number of channels in images and deletes single-channel images
- Duplicates images in the input folder
- Renames files sequentially
- Applies various filters to images
- Generates a collage by arranging processed images in a grid layout

## Usage

1. Run the notebook in a Python environment with access to PyTorch and PIL libraries.
2. Mount Google Drive if needed. (if run in Google Collab)
3. Specify the input folder containing images.
4. Run the notebook to generate a collage with filtered images.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply download the notebook and run it in a Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed.
